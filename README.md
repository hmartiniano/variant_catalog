# Genetic Variant Catalog

A simple, client-side web application for searching and displaying genetic variant information from a local dataset. The application is designed to be fast, responsive, and easy to update.

## Features

-   **Gene and Variant Search**: Quickly search for variants within a specific gene.
-   **Dynamic Display**: Variant details are displayed in a clear, expandable card format.
-   **Configurable Highlighting**: Key fields like ACMG Classification are color-coded for at-a-glance interpretation.
-   **Tooltip Explanations**: Hover over any field name to get a detailed explanation.
-   **Data-Driven UI**: The entire display logic is driven by a simple configuration block in `app.js`, making it easy to change how data is presented.

## How to Use

1.  **Open the Application**: Simply open the `index.html` file in a modern web browser.
2.  **Select a Gene**: Use the dropdown menu to select the gene you want to search within.
3.  **Enter a Variant**: Type the identifier for the variant you are looking for (e.g., rsID, HGVS notation) into the search box.
4.  **Click Search**: The application will display the details for the matching variant.

## How to Update the Data

The application's data is managed through a simple two-step process using the provided Python scripts.

### Prerequisites

-   Python 3
-   `pandas` and `openpyxl` libraries. Install them with pip:
    ```bash
    pip install pandas openpyxl
    ```

### Update Workflow

1.  **Prepare Your Data**: Ensure your variant data is in an Excel file (`.xlsx`). The script expects a column named "Gene" to group the variants correctly.

2.  **Run the Conversion Script**: Execute the `convert_data.py` script, providing your Excel file as input and `data.json` as the output.

    ```bash
    python convert_data.py your_spreadsheet.xlsx data.json
    ```

3.  **Reload the Application**: Once the script completes, the `data.json` file in the project directory will be updated. Simply reload `index.html` in your browser to see the new data.

## File Structure

-   `index.html`: The main HTML file for the application.
-   `style.css`: Contains all the custom styles for the application.
-   `app.js`: The core application logic, including data fetching, search, and display rendering.
-   `data.json`: The file containing all the variant data. **This file is generated by the conversion script.**
-   `convert_data.py`: The Python script used to convert variant data from an Excel file into the `data.json` format.
-   `README.md`: This file.
